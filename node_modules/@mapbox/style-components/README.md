# style-components

A library to validate style components and compile those components into a Mapbox GL JS stylesheet.

A style component is a configurable bundle of layers that makes advanced styling more accessible for novice users and faster for expert users. For example, Thelma authors a road network component, and Louise wants to use that road network component in their map style. The component only exposes a single configuration property, color, that Louise must define. Within the component's layers, Thelma has abstracted away how that color incorporates with the road network along with other advanced cartographical choices. Thelma has full flexibility through component authoring while Louise has a beautiful road network with very little configuration.

See the [style component specification](./docs/spec-proposal.md) for more information.

## Usage

This library is compiled for use in browsers and Node.js.

### Compiler

The compiler transforms a style component into a Mapbox GL JS stylesheet. See [the compiler documentation](./docs/COMPILER_DOCUMENTATION.md) for more information.

### Validators

The validators confirm that the style component satisfies the specification. See [the validator documentation](./docs/VALIDATION_DOCUMENTATION.md) for more information.
